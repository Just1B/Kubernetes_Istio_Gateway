# Istio Gateway and VirtualServices on GKE

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-go.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

We will deploy 2 pods an dispach traffic with the Istio Gateway

Requirements

- A Cluster Already Online
- Istio on the cluster

## Step 1: Services

We will deploy 2 `hashicorp/http-echo` server an use the ingress to point on subdomains.

First create the fruits namespace

```
kubectl create namespace fruits
```

Deploy the http-echo servers

```
kubectl apply -f apple.yml
```

```
kubectl apply -f banana.yml
```

## Step 2: The Gateway

![index](https://github.com/Just1B/Kubernetes_Istio_Gateway/raw/master/screens/gateway.png)

Istio ingress gateway are like ingress controller, but unlike traditional ones, it does not rely on native Kubernetes Ingress objects. It uses its own custom resources: Gateway, VirtualService, DestinationRule, etc. Using custom resources provides more flexibility in configuring network policies

Let's deploy the gateway in the namespace `fruits` and listen on port 80

```
kubectl apply -f gateway.yml
```

Next we will need the gateway `EXTERNAL-IP` to point our domains

```
kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
```

Now you can point 2 subdomains ( TYPE A ) on the `EXTERNAL-IP`

Propagation can be long so wait for it ðŸ˜´

## Step 3: VirtualService

We need to create a VirtualService for each of the services we want to expose, edit `virtual-service.yml`

```
kubectl apply -f virtual-service.yml
```

## Clear the Stack

You can delete the `fruits` Namespaces
